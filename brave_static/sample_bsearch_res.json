It was my first Mass in Blessed Sacrament Parish in Trenton, New Jersey, June 1967. The new Vatican II liturgy was scheduled to begin the following week, but we were forbidden to jump the gun. My mother bought a portable altar, so I wouldn't have to say my first Mass with my back to the people.",

When the service was over and there was no Father Stephen coming out of the altar, she began to cry. That was when her mother discovered she had been looking for me all morning.",
          "I have rarely met a young adult who had fallen away from the faith who did not have a story that included disappointment in a priest or in a layman. God, indeed have mercy on us! On the other hand – I had opportunity to meet with the Anglican priest under whom I first received my vocation to the priesthood when I was a teenager. He is now elderly and still a solid believer. He embraced me and was so glad to see the decision I had made (to be Orthodox) and with tears in his eyes he begged me to forgive him and the Church which had failed in so dramatic a way.",
          "The other day the child pointed to the altar and said, “That’s where you live.” I was at a loss to respond. I could not look at the altar and say, “I do not live there, I only work there,” for the altar is not that sort of place. Indeed I do “live” there, and more fully than I live any other place. But it took a child to point it out to me.",

Liturgy geeks will recognize this as the psalm that in the Extraordinary Form is part of the prayers at the foot of the altar. Even though this prayer was removed from the Mass in 1964, there is no reason not to pray it beforehand. Indeed, historically this prayer was intended to be said in preparation for Mass and gradually got absorbed into the Mass. When Rome removed it, I believe they intended that it be returned to its historic place as a devotion of the ministers before Mass.",
